map_info=	- - B I T E R    B A T T L E S - -\n\n	Your objective is to defend your team's rocket silo and defeat the other team.\n	Feed the opponent's biters with science packs to increase their strength.\n	High tier science juice will yield stronger results.\n\n	There is no major direct pvp combat.\n	The horizontal border river is landfill proof.\n	Construction robots can not build on the other teams's side.\n	The random map layout is mirrored to provide a fair competition.\n\n	West and East directions contain no biter nests,\n	leaving room for factory expansion and outpost building.\n	North and South directions are biter territory.\n\n	There is no biter evolution from pollution, or destruction.\n	ONLY feeding increases their power and will lead to your teams victory.\n\n	The gui yields two different main stats for each team's biters.\n\n	    - EVO -\n	    The evolution of the biters, which increases when they get fed.\n	    It can go above 100% which unlocks endgame modifiers,\n	    granting them increased damage and evasion.\n\n	    - THREAT -\n     Causes biters to attack and reduces when biters are slain.\n	    Feeding gives permanent "threat-income", as well as creating instant threat.\n	    A high threat value causes big attacks.\n	    Values of zero or below will cause no attacks.

map_info_text=The biters have catched the scent of fish in the market.\nFend them off as long as possible!\nThis however will not be an easy task,\nsince their strength and resistance increases constantly over time.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to evacuate all the fish to cat planet!\nPut them in your rocket's cargo and launch them into space.\nDon't worry, you will still get space science.\n\nThe Market will gladly take any coin you might find.\nAdditional turret slots can be bought at the market.\nSeveral unique upgrades are available too.\nResearching tanks will unlock the artillery technology early.\nAny container bearing dangerous goods, like ammo, grenades or barrels,\ncauses heavy explosions when it breaks.\nMaybe this can be used to our advantage.
